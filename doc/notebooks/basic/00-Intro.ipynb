    "\n",
    "1. It is an open source development\n",
    "2. It is being developed by the technological development group of [Combusti√≥n Ingenieros S.A.S](http://www.cihologramas.com), and the applied optics group of the [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](http://www.unal.edu.co).\n",
    "3. It is written in [python](http://www.python.org) y [cython](http://www.cython.org).\n",
    "4. It is written using the [object oriented programming paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming.)\n",
    "5. It can perform non-sequential ray-tracing of complex 3D systems. \n",
    "6. It can be used as a module to develop programs to simulate optical systems. \n",
    "7. It can be used in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://www.jupyter.org) to perform interactive simulation tasks \n",
    "8. There is a [FreeCAD](https://www.freecadweb.org/) workbench under development, to simplify its applications to optical design tasks. This development is being hosted in https://github.com/cihologramas/freecad-pyoptools "
