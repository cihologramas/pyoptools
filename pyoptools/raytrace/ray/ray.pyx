        system. Defaults to an empty string.

        color identifier can be used. Defaults to `None`.

        The parent ray from which this ray originates, used to follow the
        ray's trajectory. Defaults to `None`.
    pop : float, optional

        Parameters
        ----------
        origin : Vector3d&
            An eigen::Vector3d instance representing the origin of the Ray.
            Must be a 3D point in space (x, y, z).
        direction_ptr : Vector3&
            An eigen::Vector3d instance representing the direction vector of
            the Ray. Must be a 3D direction vector (x, y, z) with a magnitude
            of 1.
            Note: The magnitude is not checked for efficiency; ensure it is
            normalized before passing.
        intensity : double
            Floating point number representing the intensity of the Ray.
            Warning: Ensure a physically correct definition of intensity.
        wavelength : double
            Wavelength (in vacuum) of the ray in micrometers. Default is
            0.58929 µm.
        n : double
            Refraction index of the point originating the ray.
            If None, the ray is emitted from the media and takes the refraction
            index of the surrounding environment (not from inside a component).
        label : object
            String or any identifier used to track the rays through the system.
        draw_color : object
            Color used to render this ray. If None, the wavelength is used to
            determine the color; otherwise, any valid matplotlib color
            identifier can be used.
            TODO: This should be removed, is up to the plotting engine to
            decide the color.
        parent : Ray
            Ray instance representing the parent Ray from which this Ray
            originates.
        pop : double
            The optical path length of the parent ray. This may be removed
            in future versions. Defaults to 0.0.
            TODO: Check if this may be removed
        orig_surf : list
            A list representing the originating surface of the ray. Defaults
            to `None`.

        order : int

            provided arguments.

        Notes
        -----
        - This function directly initializes Ray attributes for fast
        construction, bypassing the usual Python __init__ method for
        performance reasons.
        - Be cautious when modifying the initialization parameters or the
        corresponding __init__ method to ensure consistency.
        - The direction vector's magnitude must be 1. However, for efficiency,
        this is not checked in the function. Ensure the direction is
        normalized before passing it to this function.
