    Create a composite transformation matrix from translation and rotation parameters.

    This function generates a 4x4 transformation matrix that combines both rotation and translation.
    The rotation is applied first, followed by the translation. The rotation is defined by Euler angles

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : tuple
        A 3-element tuple representing the translation vector (Tx, Ty, Tz).
    R : tuple

    Notes
    -----

    It then creates a mesh representation of this surface, which can be 
    displayed in a Jupyter notebook using pythreejs. The function allows for the

    optionally displayed as a wireframe.

    Parameters
    ----------
    S : object
        The surface object to be converted into a mesh. This object must have a 
        `polylist` method that returns two elements: a list of points and a list

    P : tuple of float, optional
        A 3-element tuple representing the translation vector (Tx, Ty, Tz) to be
        applied to the mesh.
        Default is (0, 0, 0), meaning no translation.
    D : tuple of float, optional
        A 3-element tuple representing the Euler angles (psi, phi, theta) in

    Convert a pyOpTools Component or (Sub) System into a mesh representation for

    This function takes a Component or System object from pyOpTools and converts
    it into a mesh representation using pythreejs. This enables the visualization
    of the object in a Jupyter notebook. The function is capable of handling both
    individual components and systems composed of multiple components. It applies
    a transformation to the mesh based on the provided translation and rotation
    parameters.

    Parameters
    ----------
    C : Component or System
        The pyOpTools Component or System object to be converted into a mesh. If
        a Component is provided, the function will convert its surfaces into
        meshes. If a System is provided, the function will recursively convert all
        components within the system into meshes.
    P : tuple of float
        A 3-element tuple representing the translation vector (Tx, Ty, Tz) to be
        applied to the mesh. This moves the mesh to the specified position in the

    Convert a ray and its child rays into a list of line segments.

    This function recursively processes a ray and its children (if any) to extract
    their positions and directions, converting them into a list of line segments.
    Each line segment is represented by a pair of points (start and end), where
    each point is a list of its coordinates. The function is designed to work with
    rays that have a tree-like structure, where each ray can spawn multiple child rays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ray : object
        The ray object to be converted. This object must have attributes `pos` (position),
        `dir` (direction), `childs` (list of child rays), and `intensity` (indicating
        the ray's intensity).

    Returns
    -------

        A list of line segments, where each line segment is represented as a list
        containing two lists, each of which represents the coordinates of the start
        and end points of the segment.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function assumes that the ray object and its children have the necessary
      attributes (`pos`, `dir`, `childs`, `intensity`) correctly defined.
    - If a ray has no children, its direction is extended by a factor of 10.0 units
      to create the end point of the line segment.

    This function takes a ray object, which may include child rays, and

    pythreejs. Each line segment represents the path of the ray or one of its
    child rays. The color of the lines is determined by the wavelength of the
    ray, if `draw_color` is not specified, or by the specified `draw_color`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ray : object
        The ray object to be converted into a mesh. This object must have
        attributes such as `wavelength` and optionally `draw_color` to
        determine the color of the line. It should also support a structure

        ray's wavelength or its specified `draw_color`, allowing for visual
        differentiation of rays in a rendered scene.

    Notes
    -----
    - The function uses the `ray2list` function to convert the ray and its
      children into a list of line segments.
    - The color of each line is determined by converting the ray's wavelength
      to RGB values if `draw_color` is not provided. If `draw_color` is
      provided, it is converted to RGB values directly.

    rot : list of tuples, optional
        A list of rotation tuples, each representing a rotation around the x, y,
